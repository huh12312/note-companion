Always extract:
- Discussion points (key topics and ideas)
- Action items (tasks with owners and deadlines if mentioned)
- Decisions made
- Key takeaways

Format the output as clean markdown with proper headings and structure.

IMPORTANT: The Full Transcript section MUST always be wrapped in a markdown code block using triple backticks. The transcript should appear between opening and closing triple backticks.`;

Create a structured meeting note with:
- Title (extract from transcript or use the meeting date if provided)
- Date: Use the meeting date provided above, or extract from transcript if not provided
- Discussion Points (numbered list)
- Action Items (with owners and deadlines if mentioned)
- Decisions
- Full Transcript section: The transcript MUST be labeled with the recording file name (e.g., "### Transcript: ${recordingFileName || 'Recording'}") and wrapped in a markdown code block with triple backticks.

Format as clean markdown. Use actual dates - do not use placeholders like "[Insert Date]". Always wrap the transcript in a code block and label it with the recording file name. Do NOT include a "Duration" field since multiple recordings may be used.`

Instructions:
1. Identify the user's original notes (content that appears BEFORE any "## Discussion Points", "## Action Items", "## Decisions", or "## Full Transcript" sections)
2. PRESERVE the user's original notes exactly as written - do not modify, remove, or restructure them
3. If enhanced sections already exist, MERGE the new content from THIS transcript with the existing content:
   - **Discussion Points**: Combine points from both, removing duplicates and similar items
   - **Action Items**: Merge action items, removing duplicates (same task/person)
   - **Decisions**: Merge decisions, removing duplicates
   - **Full Transcript**: CRITICAL - You MUST preserve ALL existing transcripts. Look for existing "### Transcript:" or "### From:" sections and KEEP THEM ALL. Append this new transcript as a new labeled section. Do NOT replace or remove existing transcripts.
4. If enhanced sections don't exist yet, create them with content from this transcript
5. Add/update the following sections after the user's original notes:
   - ## Discussion Points (merged from all recordings)
   - ## Action Items (merged from all recordings)
   - ## Decisions (merged from all recordings)
   - ## Full Transcript (all transcripts combined, each clearly labeled with its recording file)

CRITICAL:
- The user's original notes must appear first, unchanged
- MERGE content from this transcript with existing enhanced sections (don't replace - merge intelligently)
- Remove duplicates and similar items when merging
- For Full Transcript: Each transcript MUST be labeled with its recording file name (e.g., "### Transcript: ${recordingFileName || 'Recording'}" or "### From: ${recordingFileName || 'Recording'}")
- Append this new transcript as a new labeled section within the Full Transcript section
- Use actual dates and durations if provided above - do not use placeholders like "[Insert Date]"
- Always wrap each transcript in its own code block with triple backticks
- If multiple transcripts exist, each must be clearly labeled with its source recording file name`;
